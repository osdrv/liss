![LISS Logo](https://github.com/osdrv/liss-doc/blob/main/img/liss-1.png?raw=true)

Liss is a functional programming language with a Lisp-like syntax. It is a compiled language that runs on its own virtual machine.

## Features

*   **Lisp-like Syntax:** Uses S-expressions for a simple and consistent syntax.
*   **Functional:** Emphasizes a functional programming style.
*   **Compiler and VM:** Compiles to bytecode that runs on a custom virtual machine.
*   **REPL:** Includes an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop for experimentation.

## Example

Here is a simple Liss program that adds two numbers:

```lisp
(+ 1 2)
```
